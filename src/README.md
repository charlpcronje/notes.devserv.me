## Ideas to think about

It happens every now and then that I think of something that I believe warrants some more time, also I know it always happens when you tell someone about a new idea, that person usually have a few good ideas that goes with yours etc.
So I'm going t start writing down some of my ideas here and hopefully I get some feedback from people. I'd like to know what you think of the idea, if you think it's worth spending more time on, if you think it is worth investing on, or anything else you might think of that can perhaps be useful, __or even tell you if you think it is a worthless crazy idea so that I can delete it before I bring more embarrassment upon myself ü§£__
